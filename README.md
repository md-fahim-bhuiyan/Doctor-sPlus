# Doctor'sPlus
## Bringing Healthcare to Your Doorstep
Doctor'sPlus is a web-based platform that provides online medical consultations, online ordering of medicine, diagnostic services at your doorstep, and information on blood and organ donations. With Doctor'sPlus, you can easily access healthcare services, regardless of your location.
### Problem Statement
Bangladesh is a densely populated country with a high percentage of rural areas where healthcare services are not easily accessible. The majority of the population residing in these areas are often unable to receive proper medical care due to the shortage of healthcare facilities and doctors. They often have to travel long distances to reach a healthcare facility, which is not only time-consuming but also expensive.

In this context, Doctor'sPlus aims to provide a solution to these problems by offering virtual healthcare services and telemedicine consultations to the rural population in Bangladesh. By providing access to healthcare services from the comfort of their homes, Doctor'sPlus can bridge the gap between the rural population and healthcare facilities.
